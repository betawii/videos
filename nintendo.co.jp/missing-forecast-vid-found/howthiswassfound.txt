nintendo.co.jp had hd footage of alot of ebta wii channels, but sadly the videos were wiped.

buttttt, the forecast channel one was recently recovered by a user called "tcoffa",
called "Wii Forecast Channel - Beta footage (9/14/2006), althought it was reuploaded may 1st 2022, the original video was dated 9/14/2006 (the day of the other kiosk channel videos!)
and it has HD sounds!
