This was found by looking up wii channel before:2007.
called "nintendo wii channel" uploaded by suicidedragon88 (WITH ONLY 1 SUB AND 6,742 VIEWS SO BIG FIND)
it was uploaded Nov 13, 2006 (remember the wii came out nov 19th)
so this shows quite a bit of english photos of the early wii menu, and information about title prices.

more about the Mii Channel is dated Nov 5, 2006
