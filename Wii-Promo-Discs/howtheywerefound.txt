The videos were ripped from https://archive.org/details/NintendoWiiPreviewDVDNintendo2006 for the highest quality.

although the archive creator doesnt know the exact date, i saw some videos on youtube dated "Nov 10, 2006",
you would think that means its all after beta wii content, BUT it also has beta wii photos and videos from earlier
in the year (wii sports unused music, early wii menu photos, etc)!

proof that the discs date is nov 10, 2006:
