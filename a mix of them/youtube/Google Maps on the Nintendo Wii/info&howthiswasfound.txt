looking on youtube for "http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/" i found:
"Google Maps on the Nintendo Wii", based off the description it mentions "https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/topics/wii_preview/presentation/08.html", and the only video thats gone there with a internet channel thumbnail is prob this one.
(it seems to only be the google maps part as the blank videos thumbnail on the 08.html likely shows them on google clicking the maps option)
based off their channel, maybe they were an opera developer..?
