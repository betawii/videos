A little video i made of wii games. cuz im bored and i saw someone else do it and i think mine is pretty cool. notice the timing 
from sound to video. like when it says such great heights its a airplane. or when it says can not fly riddly is falling, or when it 
says troubled head the bosses head is its weakspot. little things like that. give me your thoughts also you can check it out on
