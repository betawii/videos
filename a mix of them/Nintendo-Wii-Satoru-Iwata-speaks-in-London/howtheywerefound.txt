Description:
Satoru Iwata’s Rarest Speeches #3: London, 2006. 
This is my original - and the maybe the only full - recording of 
Iwata’s Sep 15, 2006 Nintendo Wii speech in London. Enjoy! All 3 in this series:
Paris: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZuHutgOcfo
Tokyo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPbg0lULIA8
London: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaqkN9Ejgxc

On this London speech, we wrote at the time: "It was a ridiculously busy week for Nintendo staff everywhere, as the company co-ordinated three major Wii press events around the world in two days, with global president Satoru Iwata making his way from the Tokyo premiere to the London finale to add his personal touch to the western proceedings. With around 700 hand-picked attendees, the pan-European event was a significantly bigger affair than the 180 guests invited to the New York event the day before - and a fitting conclusion to the week's activities, with a slick show that was undoubtedly one of Nintendo's most effective seen on UK soil. Iwata emerged on-stage in a 'surprise' appearance to give NOE president Shibata a telling off, before his presentation."
